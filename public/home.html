  <h2 class="welcometext">Welcome to Resettlement Hub</h2>
  <div class="bodytext">
    <h4>A nonprofit and volunteer networking hub centered on refugee resettlement efforts</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="bodytext">
    <h5>There are plenty of other volunteering websites the world over, but this one was created by a guy lucky enough to have years of experience (some would say a lifetime) helping refugees resettle in the U.S. That said, I've designed the site to be admin-centric, but also for use by anybody interested in finding ways to help those fleeing from disasters.
    </h5>
    <h5>The best I can hope for is that this site has helped you in your mission to help refugees and asylum seekers in any way. Thank you for visiting, and enjoy your stay!</h5>
  </div>

  <div class="bodytext">
    <h3>* DISCLAIMER:</h3>
    <h5>The site you are about to experience is still very, very much in progress. If you notice any bugs or broken links, PLEASE email me at murtato@gmail.com and I'll fix them as soon as possible. Also if you're a nonprofit and I've used your name as dummy data, please don't sue me. I'm not worth it (yet)</h5>
    <p class="snark">Not bad for a guy who still breaks code with copy and paste, eh?</p>
